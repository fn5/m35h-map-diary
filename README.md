# m35h-map-diary

A set of notes around the Telstra Smart Wi-Fi Booster 2 - M35H-MAP made by Arcaydan. It seems to have Arcaydan model WE410443B-TA-01

The objective of this repo is to share the notes and debug functionality for self-educational purposes.
I have grabbed a few of these and hoping to understand more about how they work.
My contact details are on my profile page if you would like to help me out. I am also exploring the 3rd iteration of this product [here](https://github.com/fn5/m35-emr2-diary).

## To-do

* Access web interface, dump HAR
